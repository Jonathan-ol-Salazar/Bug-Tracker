### Status 
The project has currently stopped development, but still provides the basic functionality of a tradition issue tracking system. For a full breakdown on the remaining feature requests to be implmented, please refer to **Remaining Features Requests**.

# Bug Tracker

This project functions as a traditional issue tracking system in which bugs and feature requests can be tracked throughout a software product development phase. The project is a web application and was created using an MVC design pattern and MongoDB as its main database program.

## Motivation 

The motivation behind the creation of this project was to develop my first full-stack web application. At the time, I had very little experience with C# so I figured, completing such a large project associated with aspects and knowledge I lacked would give me an enormous learning advantage as it would force me to not only learn new concepts but also implement them into practice.
